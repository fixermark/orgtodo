* OrgTodo, a simple task tracker for Sandstorm

#+ATTR_HTML: :align center

*OrgTodo* is a simple TODO list for [[https://sandstorm.org/][Sandstorm]] that features easy integration with [[https://sandstorm.org/][emacs org-mode]] (via copy-paste). It can be run as a Sandstorm app.

** TODO add link to source page

* Using OrgTodo

After creating a grain in OrgTodo, you should see the following:

** Creating TODO items

There are two ways to create some TODO items.

*** One-at-a-time

Click on *New Task*. You can specify a headline and main body text below.

#+ATTR_HTML: :align center

If you want to have checkboxes underneath your TODO item, click *Add Checkboxes*.

Click *Create New Task*.

*** Full import

Click on *Import from org*. The dialog box lists all the TODO items in the grain
as a series of headlines.

#+ATTR_HTML: :align center
[[./img/import-from-org.png]]

Note that several items are added here:

- *ID property*: unique identifier to allow the TODO item to be tracked in the
  database
- *TimeTrackerPriority*: Tracks how the items in the TODO list should be
  sorted. Lower numbers are higher priority.

The text in the box can be copied-and-pasted directly into an emacs org
file. Conversely, An emacs org file's contents can be copied and pasted into
this dialog. Every headline will be interpreted as a TODO item (but see [[*Import caveat][Import
caveat]] below).

Clicking *Submit* will /replace/ all existing TODOs with the ones you specify.

**** Import caveat

- Headline nesting isn't maintained on import; each headline, regardless of
  level, is treated as a top-level TODO item and will be rearranged by reordering.
- org DEADLINE is supported, but the only way to set one is to specify it in
  the *Import from org* dialog. Also, if the entry lacks a ~:PROPERTIES:~ block, the
  DEADLINE will be interpreted as part of the body.
- Checkboxes are supported, but simply: OrgTodo interprets ~- [ ]~ as unchecked
  and ~- [anything]~ as checked (though it emits ~- [X]~ for checked when the value
  is changed...Hi Postel!).

** Editing items

From the main interface, you can modify items' status and priority and adjust
how they are displayed.

To change the status of a TODO item, click the red ~TODO~ bar. This changes it to
DONE.

#+ATTR_HTML: :align center

The four buttons at the bottom of a TODO item control ordering. The outer two
move an item to the top or bottom of the list; the middle two swap it with its
neighbor one higher or one lower in priority.

You can also get a detailed view of one item by clicking its body text. In this
view, items that have checkboxes associated will have checkboxes that can be
toggled on or off. Clicking the *X* button closes the detail view.

** Controlling display state

On the main view, you can control ordering of items by clicking *Sorting by
priority* to toggle it to *Sorting by deadline*. You can also toggle the *Hide Done*
checkbox to hide items that are already marked DONE.

* Conclusion

That's everything! I hope this is useful to you.
